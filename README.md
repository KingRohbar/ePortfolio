# ePortfolio Unity
This is the Repository of my ePortfolio in Software Engineering class.

## Setup
If you'd like to follow me allong you need to install Unity.  
I recommend you to install the [Unity-Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GettingStartedInstallingHub.html), but you have to create an account eventually.  
Alternatively you can install an Unity version [without the Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DeployingUnityOffline.html).  
You can find all download links [here](https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download).

In this repository I prepared some examples and a small tutorial.  
If want to follow along you should clone this repository and open the Demo Project in Unity.  
Alternatively you can find the Skript of the Demo in the Docu folder.

The default IDE for writing code with Unity is VisualStudio you can alternatively change the Script Editor under:  
File -> Preferences -> External Tools.

 I also absolved a tutorial to get to know with Unity, you can find it [here](https://learn.unity.com/project/tanks-tutorial?language=en).   
 I will show it and recommend it to you at the end of my Presentation.
